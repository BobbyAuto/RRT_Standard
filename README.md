## Introduction
The Rapid Exploration Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is a random sampling algorithm for state space, which avoids the large computational burden caused by precise modeling of space by detecting collisions at sampling points. It can effectively solve path-planning problems in high-dimensional spaces and complex constraints. This method is probability complete and non-optimal. It can easily handle obstacles and differential constraints and is widely used in the area of autonomous robot path planning.

In this project, I aimed to simulate the standard RRT algorithm and observe the performance, and then optimize the standard RRT algorithm with an adaptive lead point method and compare the performance between them in different environments.
